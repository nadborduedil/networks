Network matching:

- The network matching strategy is driven by uniquely representing any single node in the network purely in relation to its position in the network, i.e. who it's connected to and who's they're connected to etc.
- This approach transforms a data matching problem into an identity verification problem where two nodes having very similar fingerprints and overlapping attributes are deemed likely to be the same node.
- The ability to compare fingerprints across the two networks relies on seeding a small group of high-confidence matches that exist in both networks and using them to derive network positions of all other nodes in both networks.
- Once that is achieved, proximal nodes in that created space are candidates for matching as determined by the likelihood that similar nodes are effectively identical
